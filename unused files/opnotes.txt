Opperating notes:

Searching for words:

1. Search for an exact match with context.
2. Exact match found with same context = done.
3. Exact match without context = split word (particles off, unconjugate)
4. Search again
5. Exact word match with same context = done.
6. Exact word match with different context = take first original match.
7. Translate directly.
